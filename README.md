Restaurant reservation web panel 

This project serves as a part of my [bachelor thesis](https://github.com/mohammadJaliliTorkamani/Lexeen-Reservation-KNTU-Thesis/tree/master) at K. N. Toosi University of Technology in 2020. It is a web panel implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help restaurant managers manage customers, orders, and payments. It uses token-based authentication for user management.
