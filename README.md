Restaurant reservation web panel 

This project serves as a part of my [backelor](https://github.com/mohammadJaliliTorkamani/Lexeen-Reservation-KNTU-Thesis/tree/master) project. It is a web panel implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help restaurant managers manage customers, orders, and payments. It uses token-based authentication for user management.
